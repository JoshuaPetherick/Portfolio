## Welcome!
This website represents my online portfolio of projects which I've worked on during my free time. Each project will be listed below alongside a description of what they are and how to play them. 

### Projects
#### Pong
This is a re-creation of the classic Pong game using the MonoGame Framework. 

Using the Main Menu, select whether you wish to play single player (against an AI) or multiplayer (against a local player). If playing single player then use the WASD keys to move up or down. If playing multiplayer then player 1 uses WASD whilst player 2 uses the arrow keys. The first player to meet the victory condition (as displayed at the top) will win the game. Points are scored when the ball makes it past your paddle. 

If you're looking for a challenge then you can tweak the AIs difficulty using the Settings menu.

#### Snake
This is a re-creation of the classic Snake game using the MonoGame Framework. 

Use the WASD or Arrow Keys to move your snake around. Collide with the apples to grow your snake. Each Apple consumed will cause the game to speed up. You win if you fill up every available space and lose if you collide with a tail piece.
