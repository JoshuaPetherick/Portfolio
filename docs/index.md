## Welcome!
This website represents my online portfolio of projects which I've worked on during my free time. Each project will be listed below alongside a description of what they are and how to play them. 

### Projects
#### Snake
This is a re-creation of the classic Snake game using the MonoGame Framework. 

Use the WASD or Arrow Keys to move your snake around. Collide with the apples to grow your snake. Each Apple consumed will cause the game to speed up. You win if you fill up every available space and lose if you collide with a tail piece.
